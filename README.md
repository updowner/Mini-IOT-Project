The device is designed to measure the level of water in the tanks, thus we have solutions to the problems of sudden water cuts due to the presence of an alert from the device when there is a lack of water and the heavy burden when we want to know the level of water in the tanks, and it helps in providing an enlightening effect.
Method of installation
When the device is connected for the first time, the device will broadcast a network in the name of Sparrow. We connect to it and then open the browser and enter the following link
192.168.4.1 We choose the first option and then choose the network to which we want to connect and enter the password
Note: The device automatically broadcasts a network when there is no previously saved network, so when the saved network is available, please restart the device
Second, we download the Blynk application and enter the user name and password of the device (available on the device)


I used Blynk apk, its a good apliation and very easy to use and this is how its look like after we put all the Widget :
